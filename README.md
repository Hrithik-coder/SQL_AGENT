## System Architecture

The system is designed as a state-driven graph. Instead of a linear script, the agent has the "agency" to decide its own path based on the database's feedback.

1.  **Intent Classification**: A guardrail node that filters out non-SQL or off-topic queries.
2.  **Semantic Retrieval**: Queries a **Qdrant Vector Store** to inject relevant column metadata into the LLM context, preventing hallucinations.
3.  **The ReAct Loop**:
    * **Agent**: Generates SQL queries using Llama 3.1 70B (via Groq).
    * **Tool**: Executes queries against the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.
    * **Feedback**: If a query fails, the agent receives the error and self-corrects in the next loop.
4.  **Streamlit UI**: A ChatGPT-style interface that displays the agent's thought process and status updates in real-time.

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. You will also need a **Groq API Key**.

-- Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory:

Code snippet: 
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone "[git repo](https://github.com/Hrithik-coder/SQL_AGENT.git)"

cd agentic-sql-analyst

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run employee_table.py for the table creation
python employee_table.py

# run the streamlit application
streamlit run app.py
